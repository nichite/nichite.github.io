You've found the repo for my personal site. If you're looking to create your own site using GitHub pages and Jekyll, feel free to use this as an example. Some other links I recommend:
- [GitHub Pages Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pages)
- [Minimal Mistakes Docs](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/)
- [Jekyll Docs](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Liquid Docs](https://shopify.github.io/liquid/)

If not, this probably isn't too interesting. Check out one of my other repos!
