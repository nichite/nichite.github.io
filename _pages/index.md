I was born with one hand, but I've never really had trouble doing anything.

Over the course of my engineering career, I've worked in labs at Harvard, MIT,
and NASA. I wrote code at Google. But now I'm all about creating wearable robots
that help people--namely bionics and exoskeletons.

## Project Mostly Human

To be honest, this project started out as kind of a joke. In fact, my original
name for this was "Stupid Prosthetics", where I'd create all sorts of
unnecessary and unhelpful prosthetic devices for everyday living. Really, it was
just an effort to shake the stigma of prosthetics as stiff and sterile medical
devices for victims.

But after I really sat down and started brainstorming, I had a bunch of ideas
that I thought were actually pretty solid.

1. Build and evaluate every open-source prosthetic arm under the Sun.
2. Build completely new types of cool (and/or stupid) prosthetic devices.
3. Do 1) and 2) in such a way to amplify positive, realistic representation of
   amputees and people with disabilities.

In a bit more detail:

### 1. Build and Test All Open-Source Prosthetics

You see posts about them all the time--heartwarming stories, usually involving
children, of people who just received a new 3D-printed prosthetic hand. Maybe
it's Avengers-themed, delivered by Robert Downey Jr. in an emotional display.
You see them pick up a ball with the new hand, and they cry and the parents cry
and you cry because they are "fixed".

Problem is, real-life prosthetics usage isn't just about picking up a ball and
putting it back down.` My hunch is that _the vast majority of open-source
prosthetic hands and arms are completely unusable in any real fashion_. Why do I
think this? Because even the best available top-of-the-line bionic arms (one of
which I one) Instead of a tear-jerking social media post, I plan to put all
devices I build through a grueling, standardized gauntlet of tests. This testing
suite will be the same used by prosthetists and occupational therapists for
their devices.

The biggest and best-documented
[repository](https://hub.e-nable.org/s/e-nable-devices/wiki/overview/list-categories)
of such hands is maintained by the
[e-NABLE Community](https://enablingthefuture.org/), and their devices will
suffer my scrutiny first. But the more I look, the more I find one-off designs
by hobbyists on GitHub.

Are any of these devices any good? Let's find out. If so, they can influence my
future designs. If not, I can make a note of it to prevent potential device
recipients from wasting their time.

### 2. Take Bionics in a New Direction

I've studied bionics devices for a long time and have used them for even longer.

I'm partnering with [e-NABLE](https://enablingthefuture.org/) to expand the
types of open-source bionic devices available to the public. Their devices will
be the first to suffer my scrutiny.

### 3. Make a Positive Impact in the Amputee Community

This one is gonna take a long time, especially since progress on my custom
bionics is slow. To speed things up, well, I started making silly videos on the
internet.

And, I gotta say, they've had way more traction than I could have imagined.
