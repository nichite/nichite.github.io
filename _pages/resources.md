        University of Michigan to create a **fully open-source bionic leg
        design** that can be replicated by labs and companies across the world.

    excerpt: |
        Pretty cool site to learn all about bionics. Sections on **bionic arms,
        legs, gloves, exos, brain interfaces**--you name it. I'd start with
        their section on [bionic arms and hands](https://bionicsforeveryone.com/bionic-arms-hands/).

        Want to really get into the weeds on the history of prosthetics and
        orthotics? This archive site has **medical journals, reference texts,
        and other literature from the last 50 years.** I spent hours and hours
        combing through these during my own research.
